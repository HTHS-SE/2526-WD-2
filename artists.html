                                            <p>Oscar-Claude Monet was born in November 1840 in Paris, France. Despite his father wanting 
                                                him to be a part of the family grocery store business, Monet aspired to be an artist at a 
                                                young age. He attended Le Havre secondary school of the arts at the age of 10. 6 years later, his 
                                                mom died and he moved in with his aunt.</p>
                                            <p>When Monet was 21, he joined the First Regiment of African Light Cavalry in Algeria. His aunt 
                                                pressured him to end his service and complete an art course at a university. There, he became a 
                                                student of Charles Gleyre and met many other famous artists. They include Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 
                                                Alfred Sisley, and Frédéric Bazille.  All of the aspiring artists shared a new approach for art. </p>
                                            <p>The Franco-Prussian war broke out which impacted the lives of many artists such as Monet. He and his wife 
                                                at the time ended up taking refuge in England, where he studied the works of others. However, his most 
                                                popular paintings were created around the time of when his wife died in 1879.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Around 13 years later, he married Alicia Hoschede. Their family moved to Giverny, France where Monet felt very 
                                                inspired. Paintings such as the Water Lilies, the Houses of Parliament, Mornings on the Seine, and more. In 1923, 
                                                cataracts started to form on Monet’s eyes. This impacted the hues and colors of the paintings. Monet ended 
                                                up passing away on December 5th 1926 due to lung cancer. </p>

                                            <p>Camille Pissarro was born on July 10 1830 in the US Virgin Islands. He lived in St. Thomas 
                                                until he was 12 years old and then went to boarding school in Paris for a little bit. Ever 
                                                since Pissarro was young, he drew in his free time. A Danish painter, Fritz Melbye, inspired 
                                                Pissarro to paint full time. He became both his teacher and his friend. When Pissarro was 25, 
                                                he went to Paris again to study under more artists. </p>
                                            <p>Pissarro married Julie Vellay and had 8 children, 6 of them ended up becoming painters. During 
                                                the Franco-Prussian War, their family had to flee France. They took refuge in Westow Hill, London. 
                                                Here, Pissarro continued to create oil paintings. The paintings depicted scenery from Central London.</p>
                                            <p>In 1890, Pissarro returned back to France. His work focused on rural and urban French life. It contained 
                                                scenes from everyday life and landscapes. It is also interesting to note  He also mentored many known 
                                                artists, including Pierre-Auguste Renoir. </p>
                                            <p>Pissarro played a crucial role in developing Impressionist techniques and theories. He passed away on
                                                November 13 1909. </p>
