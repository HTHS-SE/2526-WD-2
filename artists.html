                                                him to be a part of the family grocery store business, Monet aspired to be an artist at a 
                                                young age. He attended Le Havre secondary school of the arts at the age of 10. 6 years later, his 
                                                mom died and he moved in with his aunt.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-text">When Monet was 21, he joined the First Regiment of African Light Cavalry in Algeria. His aunt 
                                                pressured him to end his service and complete an art course at a university. There, he became a 
                                                student of Charles Gleyre and met many other famous artists. They include Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 
                                                Alfred Sisley, and Frédéric Bazille.  All of the aspiring artists shared a new approach for art. </p>
                                            <p class="modal-text">The Franco-Prussian war broke out which impacted the lives of many artists such as Monet. He and his wife 
                                                at the time ended up taking refuge in England, where he studied the works of others. However, his most 
                                                popular paintings were created around the time of when his wife died in 1879.

                                            <p class="modal-text">Around 13 years later, he married Alicia Hoschede. Their family moved to Giverny, France where Monet felt very 
                                                inspired. Paintings such as the Water Lilies, the Houses of Parliament, Mornings on the Seine, and more. In 1923, 
                                                cataracts started to form on Monet’s eyes. This impacted the hues and colors of the paintings. Monet ended 
                                                up passing away on December 5th 1926 due to lung cancer. </p>

                                            <p class="modal-text">Camille Pissarro was born on July 10 1830 in the US Virgin Islands. He lived in St. Thomas 
                                                until he was 12 years old and then went to boarding school in Paris for a little bit. Ever 
                                                since Pissarro was young, he drew in his free time. A Danish painter, Fritz Melbye, inspired 
                                                Pissarro to paint full time. He became both his teacher and his friend. When Pissarro was 25, 
                                                he went to Paris again to study under more artists. </p>
                                            <p class="modal-text">Pissarro married Julie Vellay and had 8 children, 6 of them ended up becoming painters. During 
                                                the Franco-Prussian War, their family had to flee France. They took refuge in Westow Hill, London. 
                                                Here, Pissarro continued to create oil paintings. The paintings depicted scenery from Central London.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-text">In 1890, Pissarro returned back to France. His work focused on rural and urban French life. It contained 
                                                scenes from everyday life and landscapes. It is also interesting to note  He also mentored many known 
                                                artists, including Pierre-Auguste Renoir. </p>
                                            <p class="modal-text">Pissarro played a crucial role in developing Impressionist techniques and theories. He passed away on

                                            <p class="modal-text">Pierre-Auguste Renoir was born on February 25th, 1841, in France. As a child,
                                                 he worked in a porcelain factory. Renoir painted designs on fine china and hangings/decorations 
                                                 on fans. He would also visit the Louvre to study the works of French artists. In 1862, he began 
                                                 to study art under Charles Gleyre. Renoir became acquainted with Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, and 
                                                 Frédéric Bazille. During his time in art school, he did not have enough money to buy paint. This 
                                                 was why he started to exhibit his work. Renoir did not gain recognition right away due to the 
                                                 Franco-Prussian War.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-text">At this point in his career, his subjects consisted of scenic places and nature. 
                                                As he lost access to his inspiration, the Fontainebleau, his subjects started to change. He also 
                                                began to paint portraits of people. The people painted, mostly women, were depicted to be more beautiful 
                                                and elegant.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-text">Renoir continued to travel to see the art created by different artists from different
                                                 countries. He went to Algeria, Spain, Italy, England, etc. During his summer in Guernsey (one of the Channel
                                                  Islands in the English Channel), he created 15 paintings featuring different aspects of nature. In 1887, 
                                                  Renoir was able to donate some of his paintings to Queen Victoria for her Golden Jubilee. </p>
                                            <p class="modal-text">3 years later, Renoir married Aline Victorine Charigot. She served as a model for one of his
                                                 previous paintings, the Luncheon of the Boating Party (1881). The couple ended up having 3 sons together. As 
                                                 a result, Renoir started to paint many scenes of his everyday family life. Renoir continued to paint until he
                                                was old. Even when he got arthritis, he painted. The artist sadly passed away on December 3rd, 1919.</p>

                                            <p class="modal-text">Alfred Sisley was born on October 30th, 1839, in France to British parents. His 
                                                father was in the silk business, while his mother was a music connoisseur. When Sisley was 18 years 
                                                old, he went to London to study business. He felt that this was not for him and returned to Paris. In 
                                                1862, he studied at Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre’s art studio. He met Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 
                                                and Frederic Bazille. The group painted landscapes together outside to capture the sunlight’s effects properly.
                                                Many paintings created with this technique were more colorful than previous creations. </p>
                                            <p class="modal-text">Sisley mainly focused on landscape painting. He depicts a serene and calming environment in his 
                                                paintings. Unlike many artists, Sisley received an allowance from his father. At this time, he just painted as he 
                                                pleased. However, when his father’s business failed, Sisley had to rely on the sale of his works to earn a living. 
                                                From this point on, Sisley lived in poverty, as his paintings gained popularity only after his death. This impacted 
                                                Sisley drastically because he was not used to this lifestyle. </p>
                                            <p class="modal-text">In 1866, he married Eugenie Lesouezee, and their family lived in France. The couple ended up having 
                                                two children. Even with all his challenges, Sisley was still committed to his career as a painter. He depicted places 
                                                near Paris, including Versailles, and the forests at Mali. Due to the pressure in his financial situation, Sisley ran 
                                                into some issues with his art dealer. Although he did not achieve the same amount of success as his colleagues, Sisley
                                                 maintained a positive mentality.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-text">During his last few years, he was in Wales. There, he painted various seascapes. Sisley passed away 
                                                on January 29th, 1899. It is interesting to note that he asked his friend, Monet, to take care of his kids.</p>
